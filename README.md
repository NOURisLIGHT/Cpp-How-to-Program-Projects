# Cpp-How-to-Program-Projects
This repo is typically made for projects that I did from the book "C++ how to program".
# Project 1: 
A class for invoice for a mechanic shop, and a class for vehicles and their specs.

# Project 2:
Typically its a system for shipping companies. Such as FedEx and DHL. It contains the main class #Package, & two inherited classes: #twoDayPackage & #OverNightPackage

# Project 3:
Inheritance hiearchy consisting of 3 main classes. Account which is the base class. SavingsAccount & CheckingAccount which are subclasses from Account. This system is basically made for banking organizations where they can manage their customers based on 3 levels. Either the customer has a normal account, savings account, or checkings account. Provided in main are tests for each class.
