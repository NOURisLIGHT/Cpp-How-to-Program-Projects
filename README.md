# Cpp-How-to-Program-Projects
This repo is typically made for projects that I did from the book "C++ how to program".
# Project 1: 
A class for invoice for a mechanic shop, and a class for vehicles and their specs.

# Project 2:
Typically its a system for shipping companies. Such as FedEx and DHL. It contains the main class #Package, & two inherited classes: #twoDayPackage & #OverNightPackage
